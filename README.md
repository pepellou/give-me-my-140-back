# give-me-my-140-back
Chrome extension to (at least) get my 140 count back in Twitter.
A very likely idea is to also block the "tweet" button if the 140 limit is surpassed.


## How to install

This extension is not in the Chrome Web Store (yet?), but you can install it in your local browser:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Enable (if it's not) the Developer Mode (a checkbox in the top right corner)
3. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button
4. Select the folder where you did clone this repo


## How to contribute

I'm not very good designer, nor I want to spend time coding in things like this (I'm just angry at Twitter to try and change my habits for no apparent reason). So if you want to contribute, feel free to [contact me](https://twitter.com/pepellou), fork the repo, create a PR or whatever. No licenses, no protocols, let's just be nice and that's it ;-)

By the way, not only design is required, since for example the counter does not properly work when links are included in the tweet (since twitter shortens them). Also some other ideas might arise (block/unblock the tweet button for instance).
